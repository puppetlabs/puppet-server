;; This file provides a sample `user` namespace that shows some things that
;; can be useful during development; especially if you'd like to develop
;; via the REPL.  To use this, simply make a copy of this file named `user.clj`
;; and modify it to your liking.
(ns user
  (:require [puppetlabs.trapperkeeper.config :as config]))

;; The `user_repl.clj` file has utility functions for starting, stopping, and
;; loading Puppet Server from the REPL.  If you define a no-arg function here that returns
;; configuration data for Puppet Server, it will use that config instead of the
;; defaults.  You could just supply a map literal here, but I like to parse
;; the config from my config files on disk, so that I am using the same settings
;; that I would get if I ran the server via `lein run --config`.

;; Leiningen allows users to add plugins at a global level by modifying a
;; file in a user's home directory called '.lein/profiles.clj'. This will allow
;; a developer to use their favorite plugins without adding unneeded
;; dependencies to individual projects.
;;
;; At Puppet we use a couple plugins during development there are incredibly
;; helpful. The first being
;; [Humane Test Output](https://github.com/pjstadig/humane-test-output) which
;; prints out test failures in a much more readable way so a developer can
;; easily determine what the failed output looks like and what it was supposed
;; to look like.
;; The other one is [Pretty](https://github.com/AvisoNovate/pretty) which
;; displays stack traces in a nicely formatted and human readable form.
;;
;; To enable these, paste the following into a file under your home directory
;; called '.lein/profiles.clj'
;;
;; {:user {:dependencies [[io.aviso/pretty "0.1.12" :exclusions [org.clojure/clojure]]
