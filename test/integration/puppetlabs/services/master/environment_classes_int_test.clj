       ;; info cached for other environments - is invalidated, meaning that

       ;; data.
       ;;
       ;; The test has the following basic steps:
       ;;
       ;; 1) Purge the current environment files on disk and hit the
       ;;    environment-cache endpoint to flush the cache for all
       ;;    environments, basically to ensure nothing is left around from
       ;;    other tests.
       ;; 2) Populate code for the 'test' and 'production' environments and
       ;;    see that environment_classes queries return the right info for
       ;;    them.
       ;; 3) Do one more environment_classes query for each environment,
       ;;    using the etag from the initial queries, to ensure that a 304
       ;;    (Not Modified) is returned.
       ;; 4) Change code on disk for both the 'test' and 'production'
       ;;    environments.
       ;; 5) Hit the environment-cache endpoint for the 'production'
       ;;    environment (but not for the 'test' environment).
       ;; 6) Do two more environment_classes queries for the 'test' and
       ;;    'production' environments using the etags from the initial
       ;;    queries.  Confirm that the information reflects the latest data on
       ;;    disk for the 'production' environment but still reflects the old
       ;;    data for the 'test' environment - expected, in this case, because

       ;; This test is about ensuring that when the environment-cache
       ;; endpoint is hit with no environment parameter that any previously
       ;; cached environment class info is invalidated, meaning that
       ;; the next request for class info for all environments will get fresh
       ;; data.
       ;;
       ;; To eliminate some of the redundancy between tests, this test doesn't
       ;; repeat the intermediate step of checking to see that the first two
       ;; environment queries were cached - 304 (Not Modified) returns -
       ;; between the first set of environment_classes queries and the second
       ;; set, done after the code on disk for both environments has changed.
       ;;
       ;; The test has the following basic steps:
       ;;
       ;; 1) Purge the current environment files on disk and hit the
       ;;    environment-cache endpoint to flush the cache for all
       ;;    environments, basically to ensure nothing is left around from
       ;;    other tests.
       ;; 2) Populate code for the 'test' and 'production' environments and
       ;;    see that environment_classes queries return the right info for
       ;;    them.
       ;; 3) Change code on disk for both the 'test' and 'production'
       ;;    environments.
       ;; 4) Hit the environment-cache endpoint with no environment
       ;;    parameter, expected to have the effect of flushing the cache for
       ;;    all environments.
       ;; 5) Do two more environment_classes queries for the 'test' and
       ;;    'production' environments with the corresponding etags returned
       ;;    from the first two queries.  Confirm that the information
       ;;    reflects the latest data on disk for both environments.
