    ;; The following tests are intended to show that a client is not able
    ;; to unintentionally gain access to info for a different client by
    ;; double-encoding a character in the client name portion of the
    ;; request.  This test is a bit odd in that:
    ;;
    ;; 1) The 'path' for the auth-rule needs to have an allow access control
    ;;    entry which uses the regular expression format, e.g., "/%6cocalhost/"
    ;;    instead of just "/%6cocalhost", because tk-auth only permits a
    ;;    percent character to be used in the entry name for the regular
    ;;    expression format.  Other formats generate an exception because the
    ;;    percent character is not legal for a domain type entry.
    ;;
    ;; 2) The requests still fail with an HTTP 404 (Not Found) error because
    ;;    the subject parameter is destructured in the certificate_status route
    ;;    definition...
    ;;
    ;;    (ANY ["/certificate_status/" :subject] [subject]
    ;;
    ;;    ... and a comidi route evaluation will fail to match a 'subject' that
    ;;    has a percent character in the name.
    ;;
    ;; This test may be more useful at the point tk-auth and comidi were to
    ;; more generally handle the presence of a percent character.
