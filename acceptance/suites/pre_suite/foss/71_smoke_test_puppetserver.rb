# This step needs to execute as quickly as possible after the
# install_puppet_server master step located in 70_install_puppet.rb
#
# This is because beaker uses `puppet resource` to manage the puppetserver
# service which has the side-effect of changing ownership and permissions of key
# paths such as /var/run/puppetlabs and /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl
#
# This side-effect masks legitimate issues we need to test, such as "the
# puppetserver fails to start out of the package"
