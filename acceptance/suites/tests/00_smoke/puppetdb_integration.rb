## Tests that PuppetDB can be integrated with Puppet Server in a simple
## monolithic install (i.e. PuppetDB on same node as Puppet Server).
##
## In this context 'integrated' just means that Puppet Server is able to
## communicate over HTTP/S with PuppetDB to send it information, such as
## agent run reports.
##
## This test validates communication is successful by querying the PuppetDB HTTP
## API and asserting the agent's report timestamp is not null. This means that
## PuppetDB successfully received the agent's report sent from Puppet Server.
## We can just run the agent that's on the master for this.
