##
## This class is a bridge between the puppet ruby code and the java interface
## `com.puppetlabs.puppetserver.JRubyPuppet`.  The first `include` line in the class
## is some JRuby magic that causes this class to "implement" the Java interface.
## So, in this class we can make calls into the puppet ruby code, but from
## outside (in the clojure/Java code), we can interact with an instance of this
## class simply as if it were an instance of the Java interface; thus, consuming
## code need not be aware of any of the JRuby implementation details.
