  The keys should have the following values:

  * :gem-home - The location that JRuby gems are stored

  * :master-conf-dir - file path to puppetmaster's conf dir;
    if not specified, will use the puppet default.

  * :master-code-dir - file path to puppetmaster's code dir;
    if not specified, will use the puppet default.

  * :max-active-instances - The maximum number of JRubyPuppet instances that
      will be pooled.
  
  * :master-var-dir - path to the puppetmaster's var dir;
    if not specified, will use the puppet default.

  * :master-run-dir - path to the puppetmaster's run dir;
    if not specified, will use the puppet default.

  * :master-log-dir - path to the puppetmaster's log dir;
    if not specified, will use the puppet default.

  * :max-active-instances - The maximum number of JRubyPuppet instances that
      will be pooled. If not specified, the system's
      number of CPUs+2 will be used.

  * :http-client-ssl-protocols - A list of legal SSL protocols that may be used
      when https client requests are made.

  * :http-client-cipher-suites - A list of legal SSL cipher suites that may
      be used when https client requests are made.

  * :http-client-connect-timeout-milliseconds - The amount of time, in
      milliseconds, that an outbound HTTP connection will wait to connect
      before giving up. Defaults to 2 minutes if not set. If 0, the timeout is
      infinite and if negative, the value is undefined in the application and
      governed by the system default behavior.

  * :http-client-idle-timeout-milliseconds - The amount of time, in
      milliseconds, that an outbound HTTP connection will wait for data to be
      available after a request is sent before closing the socket. Defaults to
      2 minutes. If 0, the timeout is infinite and if negative, the value is
      undefined by the application and is governed by the default system
      behavior."
