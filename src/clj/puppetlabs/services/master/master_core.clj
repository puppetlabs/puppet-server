(def EnvironmentClassesFileClassParameter
  "Schema for an individual parameter found in a class defined within an
  environment_classes file.  Includes the name of the parameter.  Optionally,
  if available in the parameter definition, includes the type, source text for
  the parameter's default value, and a literal (primitive data type)
  representation of the parameter's default value.

  For example, if a class parameter were defined like this in a Puppet
  manifest ...

    Integer $someint = 3

  ... then the map representation of that parameter would be:

  {:name \"someint\",
   :type \"Integer\",
   :default_source \"3\",
   :default_literal 3
  }

  For a parameter default value which contains an expression - something that
  cannot be coerced into a primitive data type - the map representation omits
  the default_literal.  For example, this parameter definition in a Puppet
  manifest ...

   String $osfam = \"$::osfamily\"

  ... would produce a map representation which looks like this ...

  {:name \"osfam\",
   :type \"String\",
   :default_source \"\"$::osfamily\"\",
  }

  The data types that could be used in the value for a :default_literal may
  vary over time, as the Puppet language continues to evolve.  For this
  reason, the more permissive schema/Any is used here.  General data types
  that we could see based on current types that the Puppet language allows
  today are in the table below:

  Puppet          | :default_literal value
  ================================================
  String          | java.lang.String
  Boolean         | java.lang.Boolean
  Float/Numeric   | java.lang.Double
  Integer/Numeric | java.lang.Long
  Array           | clojure.lang.LazySeq
  Hash            | clojure.lang.PersistentTreeMap

  For the Regexp, Undef, Default, any Hash objects (top-level or nested within
  another Array or Hash) whose keys are not of type String, and any Array
  or Hash objects (top-level or nested within another Array or Hash) which
  contain a Regexp, Undef, or Default typed value, the :default_literal value
  will not be populated.  These are not populated because they cannot be
  represented in JSON transfer without some loss of fidelity as compared to what
  the original data type from the manifest was."

  that all maps in the data structure become explicitly sorted with natural
  ordering. This can be used before serialization to ensure predictable
  serialization.

  The returned data structure is not a transient so it is still able to be
  modified, therefore caution should be taken to avoid modification else the
  data will lose its sorted status.

  This function was copypasta'd from clj-kitchensink's core/sort-nested-maps.
  sort-nested-maps can only deep sort a structure that contains native Clojure
  types, whereas this function includes a couple of changes which handle the
  sorting of the data structure returned from JRuby for a call to get
  environment class info:

  1) This function sorts keys within any `java.util.Map`, as opposed to just an
     object for which `map?` returns true.

  2) This function attempts to coerces any keys found within a map to a
     Clojure keyword before using `sorted-map` to sort the keys.
     `sorted-map` would otherwise throw an error upon encountering a
     non-keyword type key."
