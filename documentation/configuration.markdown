Puppet Server honors almost all settings in `puppet.conf` and should pick them
up automatically. However, for some tasks, such as configuring the webserver or an external Certificate Authority, we have introduced new Puppet Server-specific configuration files and settings. These new files and settings are detailed below.  For more information on the specific differences in Puppet Server's support for `puppet.conf` settings as compared to the Ruby master, see the [puppet.conf differences](./puppet_conf_setting_diffs.markdown) page.

## Config Files

All of Puppet Server's new config files and settings (with the exception of the [logging config file](#logging)) are located in the `conf.d` directory. These new config files are in HOCON format. HOCON keeps the basic structure of JSON, but is a more human-readable config file format. You can find details about this format in the [HOCON documentation](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md).

At startup, Puppet Server reads all the `.conf` files found in this directory, located at `/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/conf.d`. Note that if you change these files and their settings, you must restart Puppet Server for those changes to take effect. The `conf.d` directory contains the following files and settings:

### `global.conf`

This file contains global configuration settings for Puppet Server. You shouldn't typically need to make changes to this file. However, you can change the `logging-config` path for the logback logging configuration file if necessary. For more information about the logback file, see [http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html).

~~~
global: {
  logging-config: /etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/logback.xml
}
~~~

### `webserver.conf`

This file contains the web server configuration settings. The `webserver.conf` file looks something like this:

~~~
webserver: {
    client-auth = need
    ssl-host = 0.0.0.0
    ssl-port = 8140
}

# configure the mount points for the web apps
web-router-service: {
    # These two should not be modified because the Puppet 3.x agent expects them to
    # be mounted at "/"
    "puppetlabs.services.ca.certificate-authority-service/certificate-authority-service": ""
    "puppetlabs.services.master.master-service/master-service": ""

    # This controls the mount point for the puppet admin API.
    "puppetlabs.services.puppet-admin.puppet-admin-service/puppet-admin-service": "/puppet-admin-api"
}
~~~

The above settings set the webserver to require a valid certificate from the client; to listen on all available hostnames for encrypted HTTPS traffic; and to use port 8140 for encrypted HTTPS traffic. For full documentation, including a complete list of available settings and values, see
[Configuring the Webserver Service](https://github.com/puppetlabs/trapperkeeper-webserver-jetty9/blob/master/doc/jetty-config.md).

By default, Puppet Server is configured to use the correct Puppet Master and CA certificates. If you're using an external CA and have provided your own certificates and keys, make sure `webserver.conf` points to the correct file. For details about configuring an external CA, see the [External CA Configuration](./external_ca_configuration.markdown) page.

### `puppetserver.conf`

This file contains the settings for Puppet Server itself.

* The `jruby-puppet` settings configure the interpreter:
    * `ruby-load-path`: Where the Puppet Server expects to find Puppet, Facter, etc.
    * `gem-home`: This setting determines where JRuby looks for gems. It is
      also used by the `puppetserver gem` command line tool. If not specified,
      uses the Puppet default of `/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/puppetserver/jruby-gems`.
    * `master-conf-dir`: Optionally, set the path to the Puppet configuration
      directory. If not specified, uses the Puppet default `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet`.
    * `master-code-dir`: Optionally, set the path to the Puppet code directory.
      If not specified, uses the Puppet default `/etc/puppetlabs/code`.
    * `master-var-dir`: Optionally, set the path to the Puppet variable
      directory. If not specified, uses the Puppet default
      `/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/puppetserver`.
    * `master-run-dir`: Optionally, set the path to the Puppet run directory.
      If not specified, uses the Puppet default `/var/run/puppetlabs/puppetserver`.
    * `master-log-dir`: Optionally, set the path to the Puppet log directory.
      If not specified, uses the Puppet default `/var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver`.
    * `max-active-instances`: Optionally, set the maximum number of JRuby
      instances to allow. Defaults to 'num-cpus - 1', with a minimum default
      value of 1 and a maximum default value of 4'.
    * `max-requests-per-instance`: Optionally, limit how many HTTP requests a given JRuby instance will handle in its lifetime. When a JRuby instance
      reaches this limit, it gets flushed from memory and replaced with a fresh one. Defaults to 0, which disables automatic JRuby flushing.
      This can be useful for working around buggy module code that would otherwise cause memory leaks, but it causes a slight performance penalty
      whenever a new JRuby has to reload all of the Puppet Ruby code.  If memory leaks from module code are not an issue in your deployment, the
      default value will give the best performance.
    * `borrow-timeout`: Optionally, set the timeout when attempting to borrow
      an instance from the JRuby pool in milliseconds. Defaults to 1200000.
* The `profiler` settings configure profiling:
    * `enabled`: if this is set to `true`, it enables profiling for the Puppet
    Ruby code. Defaults to `false`.
* The `puppet-admin` section configures the Puppet Server's administrative API.
  (This is a new API, which isn't provided by Rack or WEBrick Puppet masters.)
    * `authorization-required` determines whether a client
    certificate is required to access the endpoints in this API.  If set to
    `false`, the client-whitelist will be ignored. Defaults to `true`.
    * `client-whitelist` contains a list of client certnames that are whitelisted
    to access the admin API. Any requests made to this endpoint that do not
    present a valid client cert mentioned in this list will be denied access.

### `master.conf`

This file contains settings for Puppet master features, such as node identification and authorization.

In a default installation, this file doesn't exist. You'll need to create it if you want to set non-default values for these settings.

* `allow-header-cert-info` determines whether Puppet Server should use authorization info from the `X-Client-Verify`, `X-Client-CN`, and `X-Client-Cert` HTTP headers. Defaults to `false`.

    This setting is used to enable [external SSL termination.](./external_ssl_termination.markdown) If enabled, Puppet Server will ignore any actual certificate presented to the Jetty webserver, and will rely completely on header data to authorize requests. This is very dangerous unless you've secured your network to prevent any untrusted access to Puppet Server.

    You can change Puppet's `ssl_client_verify_header` setting to use another header name instead of `X-Client-Verify`; the `ssl_client_header` setting can rename `X-Client-CN`. The `X-Client-Cert` header can't be renamed.

~~~
master: {
    # allow-header-cert-info: false
}
~~~

### `ca.conf`

This file contains settings for the Certificate Authority service.

* `certificate-status` contains settings for the certificate_status HTTP endpoint.
This endpoint allows certs to be signed, revoked, and deleted via HTTP requests.
This provides full control over Puppet's security, and access should almost
always be heavily restricted. Puppet Enterprise uses this endpoint to provide
a cert signing interface in the PE console. For full documentation, see the
[Certificate Status](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/api/docs/http_certificate_status.md) page.

    * `authorization-required` determines whether a client certificate
    is required to access the certificate status endpoints. If set to 'false' the
    whitelist will be ignored. Defaults to `true`.

    * `client-whitelist` contains a list of client certnames that are whitelisted
    to access the certificate_status endpoint. Any requests made to this
    endpoint that do not present a valid client cert mentioned in this list will
    be denied access.

~~~
# CA-related settings
certificate-authority: {
    certificate-status: {
        authorization-required: true
        client-whitelist: []
    }
}
~~~

## Logging

All of Puppet Server's logging is routed through the JVM [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch/) library. By default, it logs to `/var/log/puppetserver/puppetserver.log` (open source releases) or `/var/log/pe-puppetserver/puppetserver.log` (Puppet Enterprise). The default log level is 'INFO'. By default, Puppet Server sends nothing to syslog.

The default Logback configuration file is at `/etc/puppetserver/logback.xml` or `/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/logback.xml`. You can edit this file to change the logging behavior, and/or specify a different Logback config file in [`global.conf`](#globalconf). For more information on configuring Logback itself, see the [Logback Configuration Manual](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html). Puppet Server picks up changes to logback.xml at runtime, so you don't need to restart the service for changes to take effect.

Puppet Server relies on `logrotate` to manage the log file, and installs a configuration file at `/etc/logrotate.d/puppetserver` or `/etc/logrotate.d/pe-puppetserver`.

### HTTP Traffic

Puppet Server logs HTTP traffic in a format similar to Apache, and to a separate
file than the main log file. By default, this is located at
`/var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver/puppetserver-access.log` (open source releases) and
`/var/log/pe-puppetserver/puppetserver-access.log` (Puppet Enterprise).

By default, the following information is logged for each HTTP request:

* remote host
* remote log name
* remote user
* date of the logging event
* URL requested
* status code of the request
* response content length
* remote IP address
* local port
* elapsed time to serve the request, in milliseconds

The Logback configuration file is at
`/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/request-logging.xml`. You can edit this file to
change the logging behavior, and/or specify a different Logback configuration
file in [`webserver.conf`](#webserverconf) with the
[`access-log-config`](https://github.com/puppetlabs/trapperkeeper-webserver-jetty9/blob/master/doc/jetty-config.md#access-log-config)
setting. For more information on configuring the logged data, see the
[Logback Access Pattern Layout](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html#AccessPatternLayout).

## Service Bootstrapping

Puppet Server is built on top of our open-source Clojure application framework,
[Trapperkeeper](https://github.com/puppetlabs/trapperkeeper). One of the features
that Trapperkeeper provides is the ability to enable or disable individual
services that an application provides. In Puppet Server, you can use this
feature to enable or disable the CA service, by modifying your `bootstrap.cfg` file
(usually located in `/etc/puppetserver/bootstrap.cfg`); in that file, you should
see some lines that look like this:

~~~
# To enable the CA service, leave the following line uncommented
puppetlabs.services.ca.certificate-authority-service/certificate-authority-service
# To disable the CA service, comment out the above line and uncomment the line below
#puppetlabs.services.ca.certificate-authority-disabled-service/certificate-authority-disabled-service
~~~

In most cases, you'll want the CA service enabled. However, if you're running
a multi-master environment or using an external CA, you might want to disable
the CA service on some nodes.


## Enabling the Insecure SSLv3 Protocol

Puppet Server usually cannot use SSLv3, because it is disabled by default at the
JRE layer. (As of javase 7u75 / 1.7.0_u75. See the
[7u75 Update Release Notes](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u75-relnotes-2389086.html)
for more information.)

You should almost always leave SSLv3 disabled, because it isn't secure anymore;
it's been broken since the
[POODLE vulnerability.](https://blogs.oracle.com/security/entry/information_about_ssl_poodle_vulnerability)
If you have clients that can't use newer protocols, you should try to upgrade
them instead of downgrading Puppet Server.

However, if you absolutely must, you can allow Puppet Server to negotiate with
SSLv3 clients.

To enable SSLv3 at the JRE layer, first create a properties file (e.g.
`/etc/sysconfig/puppetserver-properties/java.security`) with the following
content:

~~~
# Override properties in $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security
# An empty value enables all algorithms including INSECURE SSLv3
# java should be started with
# -Djava.security.properties=/etc/sysconfig/puppetserver-properties/java.security
# for this file to take effect.
jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=
~~~

Once this property file exists, update `JAVA_ARGS`, typically defined in
`/etc/sysconfig/puppetserver`, and add the option
`-Djava.security.properties=/etc/sysconfig/puppetserver-properties/java.security`.  This
will configure the JVM to override the `jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms` property
defined in `$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security`.  The `puppetserver`
service needs to be restarted for this setting to take effect.
