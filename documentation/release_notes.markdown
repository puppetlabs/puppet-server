## Puppet Server 2.2

Released October 15, 2015.

### Supported Platforms

Puppet Server 2.2 supports the following platforms:

* Enterprise Linux 7
* Enterprise Linux 6
* Ubuntu 14.04
* Ubuntu 12.04
* Debian 7

### What's New

#### New Authentication Method and `auth.conf` Format

Puppet Server 2.2 introduces support for the Clojure [`trapperkeeper-authorization`][] as a replacement for the [deprecated][] Ruby authentication system that uses the [Puppet `auth.conf` file][]. This also provides new authentication options for administration, certificate status, and certification authority endpoints.

If you enable this new authentication method, you must convert any custom authorization rules and settings to [the new HOCON-based format][`auth.conf`]. For more information on these new features, instructions on enabling them, and help converting authorization rules, see the updated [Configuration documentation][] and [`auth.conf` documentation][`auth.conf`].

* [SERVER-111](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-111) - auth.conf replacement 
* [SERVER-763](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-763) - Add allow-header-cert-info authorization support to all Puppet Server service APIs

### Bug Fixes

#### Make Certificate Authority and Master Private Keys Inaccessible to "World" Users

Previous versions of Puppet Server would not explicitly set file permissions for certificate authority (CA) and Master private keys, which could leave both keys' readable by "world" users. Puppet Server 2.2 resolves this bug by automatically setting and enforcing a permissions change that limits read access to the Puppet Server user and group.

This fix was also applied to [Puppet Server 2.1.x](#puppet-server-212) and [1.2.x](#puppet-server-122).

* [SERVER-910](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-910)

### Deprecated Features

For detailed information about features deprecated in Puppet Server 2.2, see the new [Deprecated Features documentation][deprecated].

#### Ruby Authorization Methods and `auth.conf` Format

With the new authentication methods introduced in Puppet Server 2.2, the legacy [`auth.conf`][] rules and configuration file format are [deprecated][].

#### `certificate-authority` and `puppet-admin` Settings

The [`ca.conf`][] and [`master.conf`][] configuration files and their settings are now either [deprecated][] or provided by the new authentication methods and `auth.conf` format.

## Puppet Server 2.1.2

Released October 15, 2015.

### Bug Fixes

#### Make Certificate Authority and Master Private Keys Inaccessible to "World" Users

Previous versions of Puppet Server would not explicitly set file permissions for certificate authority (CA) and Master private keys, which could leave both keys' readable by "world" users. Puppet Server 2.2 resolves this bug by automatically setting and enforcing a permissions change that limits read access to the Puppet Server user and group.

* [SERVER-910](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-910)

#### Resolve an Issue with FreeIPA 4.x CA Signed Certificates

When running Puppet agent against a Puppet Server with a FreeIPA 4.x CA signed certificate, Puppet agent fails with an error:

    [puppet-server] Puppet java.util.ArrayList cannot be cast to java.lang.String
    
Puppet Server 2.1.2 resolves this issue.

* [SERVER-816](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-816)

#### Correctly Flush Caches of Actively Used JRuby Instances

In previous versions of Puppet Server, Puppet Server could not flush the caches of JRuby instances if they were borrowed from a pool when the cache flush request was issued. This version resolves the issue.

* [SERVER-813](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-813)

### All Changes

* [All Puppet Server tickets targeted at this release](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SERVER%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20%22SERVER%202.1.2%22)

## Puppet Server 2.1.1

Released June 17, 2015.

This is a security and bug fix release in the Puppet Server 2.1 series; no new features have been added since 2.1.0. We recommend that all users upgrade.

### Bug Fixes

#### Support for Loading Facter 3.0+ / Puppet Agent 1.2.0+ With Multiple JRubyPuppet Instances.

Puppet Server uses Facter for a few things. Facter used to be pure Ruby code, but as of puppet-agent 1.2.0 (which includes Facter 3.0.0), it's a native shared library.

Puppet Server 2.1.0 had a problem with loading that shared library if the `jruby-puppet.max-active-instances` setting in `puppetserver.conf` was set higher than 1 (which it almost always is). This bug is now fixed.

* [SERVER-718](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-718)

#### Fix Defaults for puppetserver.conf Directory Settings

The `jruby-puppet` section of puppetserver.conf has five directory settings (`master-conf-dir`, etc.) for setting the [configuration directory][], [code directory][], [cache directory][], run directory, and log directory. When these settings were absent, Puppet Server wasn't properly enforcing the proper default values and could sometimes use the wrong directories, to varying effects.

This is now fixed, and Puppet Server will use the appropriate default directories if the settings are absent. Note that if you are changing these directories (and most users shouldn't!), you'll need to change them in both puppetserver.conf and puppet.conf to ensure that commands like `puppet cert` and `puppet module` are using the same directories as Puppet Server.

(The problem was that Puppet Server was falling back to the values of Puppet's `confdir`, `codedir`, `vardir`, `rundir`, and `logdir` settings. If puppet.conf was also missing those settings, Puppet Server would end up using the "user" confdir/codedir/etc. instead of the "system" ones, which was bad.)

* [SERVER-692](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-692)

#### Upgrade JRuby from 1.7.20 to 1.7.20.1 to Resolve CVE-2015-4020

The Rubygems client had security problems with wildcard matching of hostnames (CVE-2015-4020), which were fixed in Rubygems 2.4.8. To get this fix, we bumped our JRuby dependency to version 1.7.20.1. See ruby-lang.orgâ€™s description of CVE-2015-4020 or CVE-2015-3900 for more info.

* [SERVER-761](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-761)

#### Legacy Routes Service and CA Disabled Service Can Now Be Used Together

In version 2.1.0, Puppet Server would fail to start if both the "certificate-authority-disabled-service" (for running a non-CA server) and the "legacy-routes-service" (for handling requests from Puppet 3.x nodes) were enabled. This is now fixed.

* [SERVER-759](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-759)

#### Consolidate Environment Handling Behavior

Consolidate JRuby environment handling, which was previously inconsistent across the use cases of  `puppetserver gem`, `puppetserver irb`, `puppetserver ruby` and the puppetserver service.

* [SERVER-297](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-297)

#### Return Good Content-Type for CA errors

We fixed two bugs in the CA service's responses, which caused issues for services consuming the CA API.

* [SERVER-723 - Fix Content-Type header in CA responses](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-723)
* [SERVER-646 - Allow charset for certificate_status content-type](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-646)

## Puppet Server 2.1

Released June 2, 2015.

This release contains several new features, improvements, and bug fixes. In keeping with [semantic versioning][semver] practices, this release of Puppet Server introduces changes that contain new backward-compatible functionality.

### Supported Platforms

Puppet Server 2.1 supports the following platforms:

* Enterprise Linux 7
* Enterprise Linux 6
* Ubuntu 14.04
* Ubuntu 12.04
* Debian 7

### What's New

#### Backward Compatibility with Puppet 3

Puppet Server 2.1 now supports both Puppet 4 and Puppet 3 agents. This is new functionality compared to Puppet Server 2.0, which only supported Puppet 4 agents.

For more information, see [Compatibility with Puppet Agent](./compatibility_with_puppet_agent.html).

#### New JRuby Pool features

##### Flush JRuby After `max-requests` Reached

Puppet Server 2.1 introduces a new feature that allows the JRuby containers and associated threads to be flushed and re-initialized after a configurable number of HTTP requests.  This functionality is similar to the PassengerMaxRequests functionality that is often tuned in Puppet+Passenger configurations.

For more information, see:

* [Tuning Guide](./tuning_guide.html)
* [SERVER-325](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-325)

##### Other JRuby Pool-Related Items

* [SERVER-246](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-246) - Add :borrow-timeout config option.
* [SERVER-324](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-324) - Added support to the `environment-cache` API for flushing an environment by name, as opposed to only having the ability to flush all environments.
* [SERVER-389](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-389) - Increase JRuby pool default-borrow-timeout.
* [SERVER-391](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-391) - Improve error message for JRuby pool borrow timeout.
* [SERVER-408](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-408) - Expose configurable `borrow-timeout` to allow JRuby pool borrows to timeout.
* [SERVER-448](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-448) - Change default max-active-instances to not exceed 4 JRubies.

#### REST `auth.conf`

As a result of the REST API URL changes between Puppet Server 1.x and 2.0, Puppet Server 2.1 users who have modified their `auth.conf` will need to make changes when using Puppet 3 agents with Puppet Server 2.1.  Please see [Compatibility with Puppet Agent](./compatibility_with_puppet_agent.markdown) for more information.

These `auth.conf` changes follow the same changes required for any users upgrading from Puppet 3.x to Puppet 4.x.

### Maintenance and Small Improvements

* [SERVER-380](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-380) - Upgrade Jetty to 9.2.x.
* [SERVER-437](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-437) - Upgrade stable branch to jvm-ssl-utils 0.8.0.
* [SERVER-517](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-517) - Re-raise HttpClientExceptions as Ruby SocketError from http-client handler.
* [SERVER-518](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-518) - Removed the hyphen from "puppet-server" in the project.clj in order to preserve backward compatibility with dujour check-ins of Puppet Server which previously used "puppetserver" as the artifact-id. The group-id also changed from "puppetlabs.packages" to "puppetlabs".
* [SERVER-530](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-530) - Merge up stable branch from 1.0.8 release commit to 2.1 branch.
* [SERVER-544](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-544) - Reduced the amount of memory used by the master to cache the payload for incoming catalog requests.
* [SERVER-598](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-598) - To improve ability to introspect routes, we ported Puppet Server to use comidi for web routes.
* [SERVER-599](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-599) - Long-running memory test that covers latest JRuby changes in stable.
* [SERVER-614](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-614) - Fix set_connect_timeout_milliseconds error when sending report to PuppetDB.
* [SERVER-680](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-680) - Upgraded JRuby dependency to 1.7.20 in order to take advantage of some of the memory management improvements weâ€™ve seen in our internal testing.

### Miscellaneous Bug Fixes

* [SERVER-157](http://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-157) - Utilize keylength puppet conf value for generating SSL cert keys.
* [SERVER-273](http://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-273) - Upgrade to JRuby 1.7.19 / fix for jruby-pool DELETE memory leak.
* [SERVER-345](http://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-345) - Fixup usages of cacert / localcacert in master.
* [SERVER-404](http://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-404) - Properly create /var/run/puppetserver dir at service startup.
* [SERVER-442](http://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-442) - Fix for a problem where `file_metadatas` requests to the master which include multiple `ignore` parameters were being mishandled. This had previously led to an agent downloading files from the master which should have been ignored.
* [SERVER-535](http://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-535) - Tests in the `jruby-puppet-service-test` namespace were using an invalid configuration map, which caused them to throw an error.
* [SERVER-541](http://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-541) - Disabled the display of verbose output that appeared during a package upgrade.
* [SERVER-564](http://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-564) - Re-enabled the master `status` endpoint
* [SERVER-647](http://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-647) - Puppet Server failed to start with with an uncaught exception when master-{code, run, log}-dir settings were not defined. This patch addresses the problem by setting the values to nil, which will cause Puppet Server to consult Puppet for the values.
* [SERVER-657](http://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-657) - Fixed `puppetserver foreground` on Ubuntu.
* [SERVER-655](http://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-655) - Upgrade to JRuby 1.7.20 caused server fail loading the Bouncy Castle jar.
* [SERVER-659](http://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-659) - Restored broken http client timeout settings.
* [SERVER-682](http://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-682) - Fixed an issue where logback levels werenâ€™t changed unless you restarted Puppet Server. This functionality had been provided in Puppet Server 1.0.2 but was inadvertently removed in Puppet Server 1.0.8, then merged with 2.0.
* [SERVER-683](http://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-683) - Changed the logic in the `legacy-routes-service` to get the route of the master-service via the service protocol name rather than by a hard-coded service name. This allows for the `legacy-routes-service` to pull the route from whatever service implementing the MasterService protocol happens to be in the service stack, i.e., master-service for open source Puppet or pe-master-service for PE.
* [SERVER-684](http://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-684) - Append `source_permissions=use` to 3.x file_metadata requests.

## Puppet Server 2.0

In keeping with [semantic versioning][semver] practices, this release
of Puppet Server introduces changes that break compatibility with
Puppet 3.x agents. Carefully read these release notes before
attempting to upgrade your Puppet installation, as the locations of
key files have moved, and changes to the Puppet Server API might require
configuration changes.

### Supported Platforms

Puppet Server 2.0 supports the following platforms:

* Enterprise Linux 7
* Enterprise Linux 6
* Ubuntu 14.04
* Ubuntu 12.04
* Debian 7

### What's New

#### Repository Location and Pre-Installation

As with Puppet 4.0, Puppet Server 2.0 is now distributed via the new
Puppet Collection repositories. Puppet Server 2.0 is part of Puppet
Collection 1.

To install Puppet Server 2.0, you'll need to install a release package
appropriate to your operating system. See the 
[Puppet 4 installation guide][pup4install] for information on how to 
prepare your system for installation, and specific installation instructions.

* [SERVER-524](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-524) - Set
  repo-target to PC1 for 2.0 release

#### Changes to Library and File Locations

> **Note:** These changes affect your ability to upgrade
> agents. Please consult the [Puppet installation layout][layout]
> document for guidance on where to move files before upgrading.

As part of the move to a unified all-in-one configuration layout, the
locations of configuration files and directories has changed.

Due to changes in the location of Ruby gems in Puppet Server 2.0,
you'll need to move your SSL certificates and any extensions you've
installed, as well.

* [SERVER-370](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-370) -
  Change ruby-load-path to /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby
* [SERVER-371](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-371) -
  Change gem_home to /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/cache/jruby-gems
* [SERVER-387](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-387)-
  Update puppet-server config directory
* [SERVER-409](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-409) -
  Plumb confdir, vardir, codedir, logdir, rundir values

#### REST `auth.conf`

As a result of the REST API URL changes between Puppet Server 1.x
and 2.0, Puppet Server 1.x users who have modified their `auth.conf` file will
need to make changes when upgrading to Puppet Server 2.0. For more information, see
[SERVER-526](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-526).

These `auth.conf` changes follow the same changes required for users
upgrading from Puppet 3.x to Puppet 4.x.

#### Backward Compatibility

Puppet Server 2.0 is not backward compatible with Puppet 3.x agents.
Version 2.0 of Puppet Server is only compatible with Puppet 4.x
agents. If upgrading all your agents and masters in concert is
problematic, use Puppet Server 2.1 instead.

### Known Issues

#### Installing Gems when Puppet Server is Behind a Proxy Requires Manual Download of Gems

When a Puppet master must access the Internet via a proxy server, it
is not possible to use the `puppetserver gem` command to install
gems. To work around this issue until we release a fix:

1. Use [rubygems.org](http://rubygems.org) to search for and download
   the gem you want to install.
2. Run the command `puppetserver gem install --local <PATH to GEM>`.

* [SERVER-377](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-377) -
  `puppetserver gem` command doesn't work from behind a proxy server

### Bug Fixes

#### Puppet Server Reports When New Versions Are Available

Due to a mismatch in naming conventions, Puppet Server was unable to
report the availability of new versions. We've addressed this bug by
adopting the increasing preference to eliminate hyphens from assorted
project and package names.

* [SERVER-520](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-520) -
  Apply artifact-id updates to version checks in master
* [SERVER-457](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-457) - Get
  dujour working with Puppet Server 2.0.0 RC

#### Fix Inconsistent Behavior Around `always_cache_features` Setting

We've fixed a bug in puppetserver where `always_cache_features` was not always
overridden because it could be changed in `puppet.conf`. The behavior is
now explicitly managed in code rather than configuration.

* [SERVER-410](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-410) -
  Explicitly override `always_cache_features` in puppetserver

#### Fix Unreliable puppetserver Start Behavior

We've fixed a bug where puppetserver was not starting reliably from
the service management framework due to the "rundir" not being
writable.

* [SERVER-414](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-414) -
  Handle rundir creation for puppet and puppetserver in Puppet
  Server 2.x

#### Fix Misleading Silence from `puppetserver foreground` Command

We've fixed a bug where the puppetserver foreground command would not
produce any output, making it appear as if the command had not started
or was stalled. The foreground command produces debugging output
in 2.0.0.

* [SERVER-356](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-356) -
  puppetserver foreground produces no output
