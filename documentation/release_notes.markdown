## Puppet Server 5.1.0

Released September 13, 2017

This is a feature and bug-fix release of Puppet Server.

### New feature: Puppet agents retry requests on a configurable delay if Puppet Server is busy

When a group of Puppet agents start their Puppet runs together, they can form a "thundering herd" capable of exceeding Puppet Server's available resources. This results in a growing backlog of requests from Puppet agents waiting for a JRuby instance to become free before their request can be processed. If this backlog exceeds the size of the Server's Jetty thread pool, other requests (such as status checks) start timing out. (For more information about JRubies and Server performance, see [Applying metrics to improve performance](./puppet_server_metrics_performance.html#measuring-capacity-with-jrubies).)

In previous versions of Puppet Server, administrators had to manually remediate this situation by separating groups of agent requests, for instance through rolling restarts. In Server 5.1.0, administrators can optionally have Server return a 503 response containing a `Retry-After` header to requests when the JRuby backlog exceeds a certain limit, causing agents to pause before retrying the request.

Both the backlog limit and `Retry-After` period are configurable, as the `max-queued-requests` and `max-retry-delay` settings respectively under the `jruby-puppet` configuration in [puppetserver.conf][]. Both settings' default values do not change Puppet Server's behavior compared to Server 5.0.0, so to take advantage of this feature in Puppet Server 5.1.0, you must specify your own values for `max-queued-requests` and `max-retry-delay`. For details, see the [puppetserver.conf][] documentation. Also, Puppet agents must run Puppet 5.3.0 or newer to respect such headers.

-   [SERVER-1767](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1767)

### New Feature: Automatic CRL refresh on certificate revocation

Puppet Server 5.1.0 includes the ability to automatically refresh the certificate revocation list (CRL) when any changes to that file have occurred, namely the addition of a revoked certificate. Prior to this release, revoking an agent's certificate required [restarting or reloading](./restarting.markdown) the Puppet Server process before that revocation would be honored and the agent denied authentication. Revocation is now effective within milliseconds and does not require restarting server.

-   [SERVER-1933](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1933) / [TK-451](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/TK-451)

### New Feature: Autosigning supports CA certificate bundles

Previous version of Puppet Server did not support autosigning with certificate authority (CA) certificate bundles, which contain multiple certificates. When attempting to pass a bundle, Server would output an error indicating that "the PEM stream must contain exactly 1 certificate". Puppet Server 5.1.0 adds support for autosigning with CA certificate bundles.

-   [SERVER-1315](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1315)

### New Feature: Adminstrators can add Java JARs to be loaded on startup

In previous versions of Puppet Server, there was no designed way to add Java JARs to be loaded by Puppet Server on startup, for instance to provide native extensions required by certain gems. Server 5.1.0 adds a new directory, `/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/puppetserver/jars`, and loads any JARs placed in this directory to the `classpath` when `puppetserver` is started. JARs placed here will not be modified or removed when upgrading Puppet Server.

-   [SERVER-249](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-249)

### Bug fixes

-   [SERVER-1755](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1755): Previous versions of Puppet Server did not correctly handle Puppet agent data sent in Msgpack format (`application/x-msgpack`), because Server interpreted the binary data as UTF-8 content. Server 5.1.0 resolves this issue by passing Msgpack content along as raw binary data, just as it came in.

## Puppet Server 5.0.0

Released June 27, 2017.

This is a major release of Puppet Server, and corresponds with the major release of Puppet 5.0, which also includes many changes and new features relevant to Puppet Server users. 

### Platform changes

Puppet Server 5.0 packages are available for RHEL 6 and 7, Debian 8 (Jessie), Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial), and SLES 12 (SP1 or later only).

Puppet Server 5.0 is built with JDK 8, and therefore cannot run on a Java 7 runtime. Server 5.0 packages now depend exclusively upon the `openjdk-8-jre-headless` package. Because Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise) and 14.04 (Trusty), and versions of Debian prior to 8 (Jessie), do not distribute that package, we no longer provide Puppet Server packages for those operating systems.

For Debian 8, install the `jessie-backports` repository to add access to Java 8. For details, see [Installing From Packages](./install_from_packages.markdown).

### Upgrading from previous versions

Consult the [Puppet 5.0 release notes](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/5.0/release_notes.html) for more information about important new features and breaking changes. Some especially relevant Puppet 5.0 changes are also noted below.

#### Deprecation: Puppet 5 no longer writes YAML node caches

As of Puppet 5.0, Puppet no longer writes node YAML files to its cache by default. This cache has been used in workflows where external tooling needs a list of nodes, but PuppetDB is now the preferred source of node information.

To retain the Puppet 4.x behavior, add the [`puppet.conf`](./configuration.markdown) setting `node_cache_terminus = write_only_yaml`. Note that `write_only_yaml` is deprecated, and users are encouraged to migrate to PuppetDB in order to retrieve node information.

-   [SERVER-1819](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1819)
-   [PUP-6060](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-6060)

#### Deprecation/New Feature: Puppet 5 uses JSON serialization by default

Previous versions of Puppet exclusively used PSON, our vendored version of `pure_json`, for serializing communication between agents and masters. Testing showed that PSON serialization's performance was significantly worse than using JSON, and JSON adds opportunities for easier and better interoperability with other tools and programming languages.

Puppet Server 5.0 now produces `application/json` responses when a Puppet 5.x agent requests them, and consumes `application/json` request bodies sent from Puppet 5.x agents.

Server 5.0 remains compatible with Puppet 3.x and 4.x agents that use PSON, and Puppet 5.x agents attempt to request and send `text/pson` only when communicating with masters that don't support JSON communications, such as Puppet Server 2.7.x or earlier.

For details, consult the [Puppet 5.0 documentation](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/5.0/release_notes.html).

----

### Security Fix: Default `auth.conf` rules clarify what's allowed for `file_` endpoints

Puppet Server 5.0 updates the default authorization rules in the [`auth.conf`][auth.conf] file to reflect that access to the "delete" HTTP method for all `/puppet/v3/file_` endpoints cannot be granted, even if a rule in `auth.conf` would permit it. This access is always forbidden due to a hard-coded restriction in the Ruby Puppet endpoint code.

For clarity, the `file_` endpoint rules are now separated into definitions per endpoint in order to reflect the valid methods that each endpoint supports, including `file_bucket_file`, `file_content`, and `file_metadata`.

-   [SERVER-1808](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1808)

### Deprecation: Puppet Server 5 no longer runs on JDK 7

### Deprecation: Legacy `auth.conf` settings are no longer enabled by default

By default, Puppet Server uses the HOCON-based [`auth.conf`][auth.conf] file introduced in Puppet Server 2.4. This uses the `trapperkeeper-authorization` methods of evaluating access to HTTP endpoints, instead of the legacy Puppet `auth.conf` file.

Puppet Server 5.0 completes this switch by changing the default value of the `use-legacy-auth-conf` setting in [`puppetserver.conf`](./config_file_puppetserver.markdown) from true to false.

-   [SERVER-1732](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1732)

### Deprecation: Removed `resource_types` API endpoints and `resource_type` CLI face

Puppet Server 5.0 removes the deprecated HTTP `resource_type` and `resource_types` API endpoints, and the `resource_type` Puppet CLI face. The [`/puppet/v3/environment_classes`](./puppet-api/v3/environment_classes.markdown) HTTP endpoint in Puppet Server replaces a subset of the `resource_type` functionality, including name and parameter metadata for classes.

-   [SERVER-1251](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1251)
-   [SERVER-1120](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1120)

### New Feature: Performance metrics

Puppet Server 5.0 includes metrics support previously released in Puppet Enterprise, including [Grafana and Graphite support](./puppet_server_metrics.markdown), both [PE-style](./metrics-api/v1/metrics_api.markdown) and [Jolokia-powered](./metrics-api/v2/metrics_api.markdown) metrics API endpoints, and the developer dashboard.

-   [SERVER-1260](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1260)
-   [SERVER-1259](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1259)

### New Feature: Optional support for JRuby 9k

Puppet Server 5.0 packages include the dependencies for both JRuby 1.7 (running Ruby language version 1.9.3) and JRuby 9k (running Ruby language version 2.3 or later). Puppet Server 5.0 uses JRuby 1.7 by default.

To instead run Puppet Server using JRuby 9k, see the "Configuring the JRuby Version" section of [Puppet Server Configuration](./configuration.markdown).

To facilitate this, the Puppet Server packages include both JRuby 1.7.27 and JRuby 9k, increasing package sizes by about 30 MB.

-   [SERVER-1630](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1630)

### Deprecation: `jruby-puppet.compat-version` setting removed

Puppet Server 5.0 also updates JRuby v1.7 to v1.7.27, which in turn updates the `jruby-openssl` gem to v0.9.19 and `bouncycastle` libraries to v1.55. JRuby 1.7.27 breaks setting `jruby-puppet.compat-version` to `2.0` in [`puppetserver.conf`](./config_file_puppetserver.markdown), so Server 5.0 removes the `jruby-puppet.compat-version` setting and exits the `puppetserver` service with an error if you start the service with that setting.

For Ruby language 2.x support in Puppet Server, configure Puppet Server to use JRuby 9k instead of JRuby 1.7.27 as noted above.

-   [SERVER-1630](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1630)

### New Feature: Logback logging for JRuby

Previous versions of Puppet Server logged JRuby errors to stderr, which Puppet Server wrote to either `/var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver/puppetserver-daemon.log`, `syslog`, or `journalctl` (depending upon the OS). By default, JRuby also does not log debug messages.

To take advantage of the [Logback](./configuration.markdown#Logback) logging infrastructure already in Puppet Server, JRuby now uses a custom `slf4j` logger that bridges logging from JRuby to Logback. As a result, Puppet Server now logs "info" and "error" messages from JRuby into `/var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver/puppetserver.log` by default. To log debug-level JRuby messages, set the "level" attribute for the "jruby" element in [`/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/logback.xml`](./config_file_logback.xml) file to "debug".

-   [SERVER-1475](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1475)

### New Feature: Profiling enabled by default

Puppet Server 5.0 enables [profiling](.config_file_puppetserver.markdown) by default, matching the default behavior of Puppet Server in Puppet Enterprise.

-   [SERVER-1761](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1761)

### New Feature: `environment_modules` endpoint can return all modules in all environments

Puppet Server 5.0 makes the environment query parameter of the [`puppet/v3/environment_modules`](./puppet-api/v3/environment_modules.markdown) endpoint optional. Also, to retrieve information about all modules in all environments at once, make a GET request of the `puppet/v3/environment_modules` endpoint without passing any parameters.

-   [SERVER-1758](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1758)

### New Feature: Respect HTTP(S) proxy variables for `puppetserver gem` subcommand

In Puppet Server 5.0, the `puppetserver gem` command respects `HTTP_PROXY`, `http_proxy`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `https_proxy`, `NO_PROXY`, and `no_proxy` environment variables, allowing `puppetserver` to install gems when behind a proxy defined by these environment variables.

-   [SERVER-377](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-377)

### Bug Fix: Add timeout to JRuby lock requests to avoid hanging the `puppetserver` service

In previous versions of Puppet Server, a request to lock all JRuby instances would stall indefinitely was made while a single instance in the JRuby pool stalled, effectively deadlocking the `puppetserver` service and requiring manual intervention to release the lock.

Puppet Server 5.0 resolves this by adding a timeout to the pool lock request. If that timeout expires, Puppet Server throws an exception instead of locking up indefinitely.

-    [SERVER-1704](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1704)

### Bug Fix: Include Content-Type headers in static file content API responses

In previous versions of Puppet Server, responses to requests of the `puppet/v3/static_file_content` endpoint did not include a Content-Type header. As of Puppet Server 5.0, responses to successful requests include a `application/octet-stream` Content-Type header. Error responses from this endpoint include a `text/plain` Content-Type.

-   [SERVER-1826](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1826)

### Bug Fix: Require `which` command for RPM package installation

Installing previous versions of Puppet Server via RPM packages could fail with a `which: command not found` error if `which` was not installed on the system.

Puppet Server 5.0 packages require `/usr/bin/which`, ensuring that it will be installed.

-   [SERVER-1746](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1746)

### Bug Fix: Wait for `puppetserver` to stop before attempting to restart it via sysvinit

In previous versions of Puppet Server, attempting to restart the `puppetserver` service using its sysvinit script would always try to immediately restart the service, even if stopping the service failed. Also, in some cases the service might not terminate immediately when sent a kill signal (SIGKILL), which exacerbated the issue.

Puppet Server 5.0 resolves this by waiting for a grace period after sending a SIGKILL to the `puppetserver` service to ensure that it successfully exits, and attempts to restart the service only after the service is successfully stopped.

### Bug Fix: Improved handling of CLI subcommands

In previous versions of Puppet Server, `puppetserver` CLI subcommands discarded exit codes, which could prevent errors from commands like `puppetserver gem` from being detected. In Puppet Server 5.0, these CLI commands now exit with the same return code as the Ruby command would have provided.

-   [SERVER-1759](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1759)

Also, subcommands previously did not account for errors raised when loading and validating the `puppetserver` configuration. An invalid configuration could crash the subcommand with an unhelpful error message unrelated to the actual configuration validation failure. Puppet Server 5.0 resolves this by propagating errors with an unexpected format to output without modification.

-   [SERVER-1690](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1690)

In previous versions of Puppet Server, `puppetserver` CLI subcommands used `/dev/random` for entropy. On systems with limited sources of entropy, such as virtual machines, these subcommands could rapidly drain the entropy pool, leading to slow performance as the pool gradually refilled. For instance, this could cause gem installation using the `puppetserver gem` subcommand to take much longer than expected.

Puppet Server 5.0 resolves this by instead using `/dev/urandom` for CLI subcommands.

-   [SERVER-1723](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1723)

### Other changes

-   [SERVER-1807](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1807): Puppet Server 5.0 embeds `hocon` gem version 1.2.5 in the default Puppet Server gem path, an upgrade from v1.1.3 used in Server v2.7.2.
-   [SERVER-1671](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1671): Log only error output (stderr) to `puppetserver.log` for `generate()` function calls.
- [SERVER-715](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-715): Resolve intermittent 500 error status results and `isExpired(puppet_environments.clj:27)` logged errors on some HTTP API requests.
