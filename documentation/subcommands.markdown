We've provided several CLI commands to help with debugging and
exploring Puppet Server. Most of the commands are the same ones you would use
in a Ruby environment --- such as `gem`, `ruby`, and `irb` --- except they run
against Puppet Server's JRuby installation and gems instead of your system Ruby.

The following subcommands are provided:

* [gem](#gem)
* [ruby](#ruby)
* [irb](#irb)
* [foreground](#foreground)

The format for each subcommand is:

~~~sh
puppetserver <subcommand> [<args>]
~~~

When running from source, the format is:

~~~sh
lein <subcommand> -c /path/to/puppetserver.conf [--] [<args>]
~~~

Note that if you are running from source, you need to separate flag arguments (such as `--version` or `-e`) with `--`, as shown above. Otherwise, those arguments will be applied to Leiningen instead of to Puppet Server. This isn't necessary when running from
packages (i.e., `puppetserver <subcommand>`).

## gem

Installs and manages gems that are isolated from system Ruby and are accessible only to Puppet Server. This is a simple wrapper around the standard Ruby `gem`, so all of the
usual arguments and flags should work as expected.

Examples:

~~~sh
$ puppetserver gem install pry --no-ri --no-rdoc
~~~

~~~sh
$ lein gem -c /path/to/puppetserver.conf -- install pry --no-ri --no-rdoc
~~~

For more information, see [Puppet Server and Gems](./gems.markdown).

## ruby

Runs code in Puppet Server's JRuby interpreter. This is a simple wrapper
around the standard Ruby `ruby`, so all of the usual arguments and flags should
work as expected.

Useful when experimenting with gems installed via `puppetserver gem` and the
Puppet and Puppet Server Ruby source code.

Examples:

~~~sh
$ puppetserver ruby -e "require 'puppet'; puts Puppet[:certname]"
~~~

~~~sh
$ lein ruby -c /path/to/puppetserver.conf -- -e "require 'puppet'; puts Puppet[:certname]"
~~~

## irb

Starts an interactive REPL for the JRuby that Puppet Server uses. This is a simple wrapper
around the standard Ruby `irb`, so all of the usual arguments and flags should
work as expected.

Like the `ruby` subcommand, this is useful for experimenting in an interactive
environment with any installed gems (via `puppetserver gem`) and the
Puppet and Puppet Server Ruby source code.

Examples:

~~~ruby
$ puppetserver irb
irb(main):001:0> require 'puppet'
=> true
irb(main):002:0> puts Puppet[:certname]
centos6-64.localdomain
=> nil
~~~

~~~sh
$ lein irb -c /path/to/puppetserver.conf -- --version
irb 0.9.6(09/06/30)
~~~

## foreground

Starts the Puppet Server, but doesn't background it; similar to starting the service
and then tailing the log.

Accepts an optional `--debug` argument to raise the logging level to DEBUG.

Examples:

~~~java
$ puppetserver foreground --debug
2014-10-25 18:04:22,158 DEBUG [main] [p.t.logging] Debug logging enabled
