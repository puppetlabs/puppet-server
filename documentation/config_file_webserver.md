The `webserver.conf` file configures the Puppet Server web server. For a broader overview of Puppet Server configuration, see the [configuration documentation](./configuration.html).

## Example

The `webserver.conf` file looks something like this:

~~~
webserver: {
    client-auth = need
    ssl-host = 0.0.0.0
    ssl-port = 8140
}

# Configure the mount points for the web apps.
web-router-service: {
    # These two should not be modified because the Puppet 3.x agent expects them to
    # be mounted at "/"
    "puppetlabs.services.ca.certificate-authority-service/certificate-authority-service": ""
    "puppetlabs.services.master.master-service/master-service": ""

    # This controls the mount point for the puppet admin API.
    "puppetlabs.services.puppet-admin.puppet-admin-service/puppet-admin-service": "/puppet-admin-api"
}
~~~

The above settings set the webserver to require a valid certificate from the client; to listen on all available hostnames for encrypted HTTPS traffic; and to use port 8140 for encrypted HTTPS traffic. For full documentation, including a complete list of available settings and values, see [Configuring the Webserver Service](https://github.com/puppetlabs/trapperkeeper-webserver-jetty9/blob/master/doc/jetty-config.md).

By default, Puppet Server is configured to use the correct Puppet Master and CA certificates. If you're using an external CA and have provided your own certificates and keys, make sure `webserver.conf` points to the correct file. For details about configuring an external CA, see the [External CA Configuration](./external_ca_configuration.markdown) page.
